## Introduction

### Project Overview
Brief description of the project, including the problem it aims to solve and its target audience.

### Objectives
The main goals the project intends to achieve, aligned with specific learning outcomes (LOs) and AI-Specific Learning Outcomes (AILOs).

## Phase 1: Ideation, Planning, and Setup

### Ideation and Conceptualization
Detail the initial brainstorming process, concept selection, and the unique value proposition of the project.

### Agile Planning
Outline the Agile planning process, including  planning, defining user stories, and setting up project management tools.

Document phase  goals focused on setting up the project's foundational elementsâ€” proposal submission, community engagement for feedback, revision processes, endorsements by trusted members, and adoption by organizations.  Highlight how GitHub Copilot contributed to refining user stories and goals, ensuring a broad coverage of platform functionalities. Include screenshots and examples of the project board setup and user story formats.

### Description of AI Tools Usage
In no more than one paragraph per bullet point, provide a brief description of:
- AI tools or technologies used in your project.
- How they helped you to achieve your project goals.
- What challenges and limitations that you encountered (what worked and what didn't work)

### Declaration of Ethical Use
Declare the use of AI in your project as previously outlined. Address the following ethical considerations and modify the list as necessary:
- Gender or sexual identity bias
- Racial bias
- Age bias
- Accessibility
- Cultural sensitivity

Delete or add items as needed to reflect how these issues were considered during your project's development.

### Ethical Considerations
Create up to five bullet points to highlight key points of ethical consideration and how you resolved these. For example:
- Reviewed images to ensure diverse representation: Hero image edited to be more inclusive
- Reviewed text content to ensure language was inclusive: No changes required
- Considered UI for disabled or neurodivergent users: Colours edited to be properly contrasting
- Reviewed other UI accessiblity concerns: Ensured all images have `alt` tags and elements are properly `aria` labelled

### Environment Setup
Describe the process of selecting and setting up the development environment, including version control systems and choice of tech stack.

### Initial Design and Wireframing
Provide insights into the initial UI/UX design process, including wireframes and design tools used.

## Phase 2: - Basic Features Development

### Setup Basic Structure
Document the creation of the project's foundational structure, focusing on backend setup and frontend layout.

### Develop Core Features
Detail the development of core project features, noting any particular challenges encountered and AI tool usage.

### Integration and Testing
Summarize the integration process between different components and initial testing efforts, including both manual and automated tests where applicable.

## Phase 3: - Advanced Features and Refinement

### Feature Development
Discuss the development of more advanced features, highlighting innovative solutions and AI-enhanced coding practices.

### Testing and Debugging
Describe the focused testing and debugging efforts during this , including methodologies, tools used, and key outcomes.

### User Feedback
Detail the process of gathering and integrating user feedback, reflecting on how it influenced project direction and feature refinement.

## Phase 4: - Finalization and Deployment

### Polishing and Optimization
Cover the final polishing of features and UI/UX, alongside performance optimization efforts, mentioning any AI-driven enhancements.

### Deployment
Document the deployment process, challenges faced, solutions found, and provide a link to the deployed application.

### Final Testing and Documentation
Summarize the final testing phase, including test coverage and results, and compile comprehensive project documentation.

### Project Retrospective
Reflect on the project's Agile journey, lessons learned, the effectiveness of AI tools, and areas for future improvement.

## How to Setup and Run
Instructions for setting up the project environment and running the application locally.
