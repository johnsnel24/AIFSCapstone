## Introduction

### Project Overview
Brief description of the project, including the problem it aims to solve and its target audience.

### Objectives
The main goals the project intends to achieve, aligned with specific learning outcomes (LOs) and AI-Specific Learning Outcomes (AILOs).

## Phase 1: Ideation, Planning, and Setup

### Ideation and Conceptualization
Detail the initial brainstorming process, concept selection, and the unique value proposition of the project.

### Agile Planning
Outline the Agile planning process, including  planning, defining user stories, and setting up project management tools.

Document phase  goals focused on setting up the project's foundational elements— proposal submission, community engagement for feedback, revision processes, endorsements by trusted members, and adoption by organizations.  Highlight how GitHub Copilot contributed to refining user stories and goals, ensuring a broad coverage of platform functionalities. Include screenshots and examples of the project board setup and user story formats.

### Description of AI Tools Usage
In no more than one paragraph per bullet point, provide a brief description of:
- AI tools or technologies used in your project.
- How they helped you to achieve your project goals.
- What challenges and limitations that you encountered (what worked and what didn't work)

### Declaration of Ethical Use
Declare the use of AI in your project as previously outlined. Address the following ethical considerations and modify the list as necessary:
- Gender or sexual identity bias
- Racial bias
- Age bias
- Accessibility
- Cultural sensitivity

Delete or add items as needed to reflect how these issues were considered during your project's development.

### Ethical Considerations
Create up to five bullet points to highlight key points of ethical consideration and how you resolved these. For example:
- Reviewed images to ensure diverse representation: Hero image edited to be more inclusive
- Reviewed text content to ensure language was inclusive: No changes required
- Considered UI for disabled or neurodivergent users: Colours edited to be properly contrasting
- Reviewed other UI accessiblity concerns: Ensured all images have `alt` tags and elements are properly `aria` labelled

### Environment Setup
Describe the process of selecting and setting up the development environment, including version control systems and choice of tech stack.

### Initial Design and Wireframing
Provide insights into the initial UI/UX design process, including wireframes and design tools used.

## Phase 2: - Basic Features Development

### Setup Basic Structure
Document the creation of the project's foundational structure, focusing on backend setup and frontend layout.

### Develop Core Features
Detail the development of core project features, noting any particular challenges encountered and AI tool usage.

### Integration and Testing
Summarize the integration process between different components and initial testing efforts, including both manual and automated tests where applicable.

## Phase 3: - Advanced Features and Refinement

### Feature Development
Discuss the development of more advanced features, highlighting innovative solutions and AI-enhanced coding practices.

### Testing and Debugging
Describe the focused testing and debugging efforts during this , including methodologies, tools used, and key outcomes.

### User Feedback
Detail the process of gathering and integrating user feedback, reflecting on how it influenced project direction and feature refinement.

## Phase 4: - Finalization and Deployment

### Polishing and Optimization
Cover the final polishing of features and UI/UX, alongside performance optimization efforts, mentioning any AI-driven enhancements.

### Deployment
Document the deployment process, challenges faced, solutions found, and provide a link to the deployed application.

### Final Testing and Documentation
Summarize the final testing phase, including test coverage and results, and compile comprehensive project documentation.

### Project Retrospective
Reflect on the project's Agile journey, lessons learned, the effectiveness of AI tools, and areas for future improvement.

## How to Setup and Run
Instructions for setting up the project environment and running the application locally.
